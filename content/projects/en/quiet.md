#description
I worked on Quiet.fun at [Wanaka](https://www.wanaka.studio) (btw, [their new portfolio site is dope](/projects/en/wanaka3) !). The goal was to create a website with 3D that would present the process of Quiet.fun.

The challenge was to connect and integrate Vue.JS with a Wordpress backend and ThreeJS. Some content coming from Wordpress REST API has to be integrated into 3D scenes.
