The last few months I've spent at [Wanaka](https://www.wanaka.studio/) have been mostly dedicated to building the company's third portfolio website (the last one dated back to 2016).

The biggest challenge was to have a fully functional website without the 3D that could be progressively enhanced with ThreeJS-based 3D and visual effects. Each effect is enabled or not according to the device-capabilities.

The particles interaction is build using GPGPU: the position of each particle is computed on the GPU, with a shader, instead of looping through each one on the CPU.

There are quite a few micro-interactions and Easter eggs. Feel free to [wander around](https://www.wanaka.studio/) to find them!
